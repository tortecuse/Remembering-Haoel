Sniper Elite 3 has received mostly positive reviews from critics and players alike, who praised its open-ended gameplay, its sniping mechanics, its setting and its multiplayer modes. However, some also criticized its graphics, its story, its voice acting and its lack of innovation. The game currently has a Metacritic score of 74/100 for PC, 67/100 for PS4 and 65/100 for Xbox One.
 
Here are some excerpts from different reviews:

> "Sniper Elite 3 is a celebration of extravagant carnage - and, less significantly, a big improvement over 2012's Sniper Elite V2. Its predecessor's stiff, linear gameplay has been swapped out for a more open-ended, creativity-enabling approach to stealth-shooting." - IGN[^2^]

> "Sniper Elite 3 is a third-person shooter with emphasis on stealth and long-range sniping, and it remembers the old days fondlyâwhich is great. In the campaign, I expected to sneak between checkpoints in more or less a straight line, but I found big open maps and the freedom to solve problems how I wanted." - PC Gamer[^1^]

> "Sniper Elite 3 isnât exactly polished to perfection. Graphically, itâs a classic between generations effort, slapping next-gen textures and lighting on last-gen characters and scenery, in the hope that it will still look shiny and new. There are occasional weird glitches, and the frame rate in the Xbox One version can sink to appalling lows." - Trusted Reviews[^3^]
